"""
Reverse Strings:
In this first exercise, the goal is to write a function that takes a string as
input and then returns the reversed string. For example, if the input is the
string "water", then the output should be "retaw".

While you're working on the function and trying to figure out how to
manipulate the string, it may help to use the print statement so you can
see the effects of whatever you're trying.
