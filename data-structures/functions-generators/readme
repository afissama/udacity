#Python Generators
# A generator in Python is similar to a function except of returning a value and exiting a process, a generator will pause
# the process, saving its state for next time.
# The biggest difference between a function and generator from a code persperctive is one word:
#  *return* is changed to *yield*

#Exercise_1
def prod(a,b):
    # TODO change output to the product of a and b
    output = 0
    return output

def fact_gen():
    i = 1
    n = i
    while True:
        output = prod(n, i)
        yield output
        # TODO: update i and n
        # Hint: i is a successive integer and n is the previous product


# Test block
my_gen = fact_gen()
num = 5
for i in range(num):
    print(next(my_gen))

# Correct result when num = 5:
# 1
# 2
# 6
# 24
# 120
